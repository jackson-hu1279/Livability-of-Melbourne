Need the historic twitter data file named twitter-melb.json sent to us by the lecturer (email)

File has 2.5 million tweets

Current chunk size = 25000

Should write 101 json files. The last file called extracted-(101).json can be ignored. It only contains the closing quotations and should not be uploaded to the couchDB database.
